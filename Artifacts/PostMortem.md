# Post-Mortem

## Initial Idea

I had hoped to make a 3D sword fighting prototype, along the lines of dark souls. Bassicly a character to control, and an enemy to fight. 

## Failures

I deffinitly way overscoped When I play this game I hate it. This was my first experience making something and letting it be done with in the span of 2 weeks. I didnt let myself go above 8 hours of development time, and it really shows. Alot of my time was spent re-aclamating myself with unity's animation system, as I felt animations would have a large impact on my game. This decision was very limiting and slowed down development alot as I am not an animator. 

As a programmer, I think even though I knew this was supposed to be quick and dirty, it was hard to break out of the mindset of setting myself up for future development. I would spend alot of time thinking about the class structure of my code and trying to make interactions between classes clean and reusable, but then I would realize it didnt matter and I should just go with whats fastest now. 

## Success's

Its hard to look back at this game and see whats good about it, I am happy I was able to cram in a full gameplay loop. Its very basic but you get a number that goes up the more enemies you kill, more enemies spawn in as time goes on making it progressivly harder, eventually you get overwhelmed and lose. I did succeded in learning unity's animation system, and I have a much better idea of how long implementing animations might take. I also learned that I generally want to avoid letting animations drive the gameplay when I am not an animator on the project, as I have lost a bit of control over the gameplay.
